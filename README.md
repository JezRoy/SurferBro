# SurferBro
SurferBro is a program that will help you surf the web safely, and away from the websites you don't want to go back to!

1. Block/reroute adult content  
2. Enforce time‑based site locks with password override  
3. Auto‑generate weekly override passwords sent to an accountability partner
